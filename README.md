# game-JS

I make this with the help of Udem course(The Complete JavaScript Course 2021: From Zero to Expert!)
I learn How to make page interactive using JavaScript.
About- 2 player can play this game. roll the dice every time your score will add and also you see the pic changes how much number are you getting.
if any plaer got 1 number then his/her game will be finish and player will change and teh score s/he got in that rolling it' gone.
the Hold help you to kepp those number.
Who got first 100 will be winner.
